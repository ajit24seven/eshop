Got it! Let's refine the implementation exactly to your needs. Can you clarify:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Which filter types should be supported?

Multi-Select

Text Search

Numeric Range

Date Range

Others?


2Ô∏è‚É£ How should filtering behavior work?

Should multiple filters apply at the same time?

Should filters reset automatically when another column is filtered?


3Ô∏è‚É£ Should the UI mimic Excel exactly?

Should dropdowns look like Excel's popups?

Should each column have its own filter button?


Once I get these details, I‚Äôll provide a perfectly tailored solution for you! üöÄ
